I help founders and engineering teams bring **clarity into complexity** — designing systems that scale without losing coherence, and processes that work with reality rather than against it.

For more than two decades, I’ve worked across embedded systems, cloud backends, mobile platforms, and organizational design. This cross‑disciplinary path gave me a rare perspective: great systems fail not because of code, but because **structure and intent drift apart**.

Today, my work focuses on:
- system architecture and long‑term technical alignment
- stabilizing fast‑growing products without costly rewrites
- improving open‑source ecosystems through structure, automation, and documentation
- mentoring teams who value precision, calm execution, and integrity over hype

I believe technology should **reduce noise**, not add to it — and that clarity, once engineered, becomes a durable competitive advantage.

## Where my work lives

Most of my public work lives **inside organizations**, not under my personal account. This is intentional — I build systems meant to outlast individuals.

### 🔧 Embedded & Arduino ecosystems
**JSC TechMinds** — joint venture focused on embedded frameworks and libraries  
https://github.com/JSC-TechMinds

Most of my Arduino‑related public work lives here: reusable libraries, tooling, and long‑term maintenance.

### 🧩 UI frameworks for embedded systems
**TcMenu** — text‑based UI framework and code generator for embedded devices  
https://github.com/TcMenu

I helped professionalize the ecosystem by:
- fixing long‑standing bugs
- introducing CI/CD automation
- migrating tests to supported frameworks
- improving documentation and project structure
- moving the web presence to GitHub Pages

### 🐔 Custom hardware & IoT
**Lutemi** — smart henhouse project (hardware + firmware)  
https://github.com/Lutemi

Most repositories are private by design; binaries and selected artifacts are public.

### 🏠 Home Assistant
I contributed improvements to Modbus integration in Home Assistant Core:  
https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/modbus

Alongside this, I’ve made smaller targeted contributions across various open‑source projects.

## How I work

Clients hire me when:
- a system grew too fast and needs structural clarity
- they want to avoid expensive rewrites
- architecture must match long‑term vision, not short‑term hacks
- they need someone who can speak both engineering and business
- they want a thinking partner, not just another contractor

I work with startups, studios, and established companies that value **substance over spectacle**.

---

## Writing & perspective

I write about:
- software architecture
- open‑source culture
- digital sovereignty
- systems thinking

Each piece distills complexity into something simple enough to act upon — and treats engineering as a craft, not a trend.
